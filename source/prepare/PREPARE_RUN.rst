PREPARE RUN

--------
RUN INFO
--------

The first page in the ONTOLOGY workflow is *RUN INFO*, where the user inputs the user-supplied Run name and the ONTOLOGY-supplied Batch ID. After the Batch ID is input, ONTOLOGY will populate the Marker (i.e., target amplicon), specific Primer, and the number of plates remaining in the Batch.

--------------
STARTING PLATE
--------------

ONTOLOGY will inform you what plate to start with for the current Run. The current plate is shown in green; plates included in the current Run are shown in blue, plates used in another run are greyed out, and plates available for use are shown in white. Once the starting plate is selected, the user can proceed go the **PREPARE SPECIMENS** phase of the **PREPARE** workflow.
