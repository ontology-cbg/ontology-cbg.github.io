Introduction
============

Welcome to the manual for ONTOLOGY, and end-to-end platform for DNA barcoding and metabarcoding. ONTOLOGY software is designed to work with our freeze-dried PCR microplates, and takes the user from setting up project metadata, through implementation of molecular lab workflows, then finally through bioinformatic analysis and uploading of data to `BOLD`_ (barcoding) or RAMS (metabarcoding; under development).

ONTOLOGY contains two workflows: **DNA barcoding** and **metabarcoding**. The DNA barcoding workflow is designed to facilitate sequencing of *individual specimens*. The metabarcoding workflow is designed to facilitate sequencing of *samples containing DNA from many specimens*, including eDNA analysis. The same ONTOLOGY plates can be used for either workflow.

Both workflows share a common structure. **PREPARE** establishes the run and sample metadata; **IMPLEMENT** guides the user through molecular laboratory protocols; **ANALYZE** performs bioinformatic analysis and data upload. Both have beginner workflows designed to teach a researchers new to barcoding all aspects of the protocols. They each also have **advanced user** modes, accessible via the [rocket ship symbol]. We note where the protocols diverge.
