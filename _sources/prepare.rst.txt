The prepare phase has two stages. In *PREPARE RUN* users establish the basic metadata for a run, including the batch number and the starting plate. The second stage, called *PREPARE SPECIMENS* in the DNA barcoding workflow and *PREPARE SAMPLES* in the metabarcoding workflow, is where users input critical metadata.
