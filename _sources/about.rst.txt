Getting started
===============

ONTOLOGY kits come as *batches*—a set of plates with a unique six-digit alpha-numeric code recognized by the software. Each plate in the batch has a batch code and the unique plate ID (from 1 to 24) printed on it.

ONTOLOGY is designed around the analysis of multiplexed samples pooled into a single run of a sequencer. For this reason, the unit of analysis in ONTOLOGY is the **run**.

ONTOLOGY workflows are divided into three phases: 

* **PREPARE:** Initiate run; upload metadata	
* **IMPLEMENT:** Complete molecular laboratory tasks
* **ANALYZE:** Analyze sequence data; view run summary; upload to repository (BOLD or RAMS)
